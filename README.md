## ✨ Features

* **🚀 Automatic Fast DNS Selection:** Automatically selects the fastest DNS server based on ping times, ensuring optimal performance.
* **🧭 Manual DNS Selection:** Choose your preferred DNS provider from a sorted list of known, reliable options.
* **🧠 View Current DNS Settings:** Quickly check your active DNS settings and identify the provider if it's a known one.
* **🔧 Restore Default DNS:** Easily revert to your original DNS configuration with a single command.

## 📥 Installation

Getting started with DNS Manager is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository or download the script:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nullshams/dns-tool.git
    cd dns-tool
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x dns.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./dns.sh
    ```

Once running, you'll see a main menu with the following options:

* `1` — Automatically select the fastest DNS
* `2` — Manually choose a DNS from the ranked list
* `3` — Show current DNS settings
* `4` — Restore default DNS settings
* `5` — Add a new custom DNS
* `99` — Exit the tool

## 🔐 Permissions

* This script **must be run as root** (`sudo`) because it modifies `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* A backup of your original DNS settings is always saved at `/etc/resolv.conf.backup` before any changes are made.

## 💡 Important Notes

* **Ping Measurements:** Ping times are calculated using the first IP address of each DNS entry.
* **Server Status:** Non-responsive DNS servers are clearly marked within the script's output.
* **Persistence:** Custom DNS entries you add will persist across system reboots.
